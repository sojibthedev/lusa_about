                Lusha was founded by Assaf Eisenstein and Yoni Tserruya in 2016
                with the aim of creating the world's largest crowdsourced data
                community for B2B salespeople or a "Waze for salespeople". Lusha
                offers B2B salespeople of every company size accurate and
                accessible data through its simple, self-service products. With
                Lusha, sales professionals can identify, engage and close
                prospects, thanks to Lusha's prospecting platform, web extension
                and API. Lusha's community has expanded to over 670,000 sales
                professionals and 223,000 sales organizations including Zendesk,
                Google and Yotpo.

              What started off as one developer's passion project has quickly
              evolved into one of B2Bs largest and most respected contact data
              solutions. In 2016 Yoni, a young developer, and Assaf, an HR tech
              creator, met. Together, they created Lusha, a better way for B2B
              salespeople to prospect based on community sharing, simplicity,
              accuracy and accessibility.
